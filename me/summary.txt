Hereâ€™s a concise, pointwise project description for your resume, tailored to the SalesAgent project you shared:
Sales Agent Automation Project (Python, OpenAI, Gemini, Agentic Tools)
Developed an intelligent sales manager agent to automate the generation and delivery of cold sales emails for ComplAI.
Integrated multiple AI-powered tools to generate diverse sales email drafts, ensuring high-quality and varied outreach.
Implemented a decision logic for the agent to evaluate and select the best email draft from multiple generated options.
Automated the email sending process by connecting the agent to an email delivery tool, reducing manual intervention.
Enforced input guardrails to ensure compliance and prevent inappropriate content in generated emails.
Utilized advanced language models (OpenAI, Gemini) for natural language understanding and generation.
Designed the system for extensibility, allowing easy addition of new tools and models.
Employed asynchronous programming and tracing for efficient, observable agent execution.
You can tailor the stack/technologies (Python, OpenAI, Gemini, etc.) as per your actual implementation. Let me know if you want a shorter or more detailed version!
